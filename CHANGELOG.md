## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-22

First release. conway is a Rust agent harness for agentic coding, built around
one library that serves three consumption modes equally, first-class
hierarchical forking, and a strict ports-and-adapters architecture where every
capability is a plugin.

### Architecture

- **8-crate Cargo workspace** with strictly downward dependencies
  (ports-and-adapters):
  - `conway-core` — domain types and port traits only; no I/O.
  - `conway-backends` — provider adapters (Anthropic native, OpenAI-compatible).
  - `conway-routing` — declarative role→model routing, health, and failover.
  - `conway-session` — append-only session persistence and transcript resolution.
  - `conway-tools` — the built-in tool/plugin implementations.
  - `conway-runtime` — the agent loop, supervision, and orchestration.
  - `conway` — the public facade (the single supported embedding surface).
  - `conway-cli` — the `conway` binary; depends only on the `conway` facade.
- The `SubagentHost` port breaks the tools↔runtime cycle so tools can spawn
  sub-agents without an upward dependency.

### Three consumption modes (one library)

- **Embeddable Rust library** — the primary surface. A `Conway` builder plus
  `SessionHandle` API: fully async, event-streamed, designed to be driven from a
  host application (e.g. a Tauri IDE).
- **Interactive TUI** — a terminal shell with live token streaming, an agent-tree
  pane, in-UI permission prompts, an editable input line, and slash commands
  (`/steer`, `/tree`, `/context`, `/why`, `/fork`, `/spawn`, `/resume`, `/help`,
  `/quit`).
- **`-p` / `--print` one-shot** — a clean, scriptable non-interactive mode:
  prompt from argv or stdin, streamed output, `--output-format text|json|jsonl`,
  strict stdout purity (only model output on stdout; all diagnostics on stderr),
  stable exit codes, and SIGINT handling.

### Hierarchical forking and spawning (distinct primitives)

- **Fork** — a child inherits the forker's *entire* effective context at the fork
  point as a literal, immutable, cache-friendly prefix, plus an added directive.
  Storage is O(1): one header line, zero records copied. Siblings forked at the
  same point share a single memoized prefix allocation.
- **Spawn** — a clean-slate child that requires an agent definition; it inherits
  no parent context. Fork and spawn are genuinely separate primitives — there is
  no partial-inheritance knob.
- **Copy-on-fork snapshot semantics** — after a fork the two sessions are
  independent append-only logs. Prompting the parent never reaches the child, and
  prompting the child never reaches the parent; the inherited prefix is bounded
  at the fork sequence and is byte-identical to a snapshot.
- **Bidirectional messaging** — parents steer children (applied at turn
  boundaries) and can soft- or hard-cancel them; children report progress and
  terminal results back. This is explicit, addressed messaging — separate from
  context inheritance.
- **Aggregate** — a parent can fork, spawn N differently-prompted children, and
  collect their results. A parent's `await` on a child can never hang: the
  supervisor synthesizes a terminal result on panic, budget exhaustion, or
  cancellation.

### Session persistence and continuity

- Append-only JSONL session store, one file per session, with crash-tolerant
  reads.
- **Resume** a persisted session and continue it — from both the library and the
  CLI (`--resume <id>`).
- **Fork-from** a persisted session at any sequence — from both the library and
  the CLI (`--fork-from <id>[@<seq>]`); the child genuinely inherits the parent's
  context, transitively across multi-level fork chains.
- Caller-chosen session ids (`--session <id>`), with honest usage errors on
  collision (directs the user to `--resume`).
- `Runtime::resume_root` re-registers a persisted agent as live, gated so it idles
  until its first prompt rather than racing a spurious turn against the old
  transcript.
- Full session inspection surface: `conway sessions list | show | tree | export`.

### Provider routing and backends

- **Backends**:
  - Anthropic native (Messages API), with cache-breakpoint mapping.
    API-key authentication only.
  - OpenAI-compatible, with per-dialect adapters for **Ollama**, **vLLM / Hermes**,
    **LM Studio**, and **llama.cpp server**.
- **Declarative routing** — per-role model aliases with explicit fallback chains;
  every response can be traced to which model served it and why
  (`conway routes explain`). No content inspection, no learned classifiers.
- **Health and failover** — dual circuit breakers per endpoint (transport and
  probe), a background prober, and an attempt/fallback loop that records health
  observations and fails over on transport, server, and rate-limit errors.
- **Capability-aware** — per-model tool-calling reliability, streaming behavior,
  and prompt-caching support are first-class. Prompt caching is used
  opportunistically but is never correctness-bearing (verified by byte-identity
  tests).

### Tools and extensibility

- Built-in plugins, all implemented on the *same* public Plugin/Tool API that
  third parties use (no privileged core tools):
  - Filesystem: read, write, edit, glob, grep.
  - Shell: bash execution with process-group termination on cancel.
  - Fork/subagent tools.
  - Explicit report/finalization tools.
- **Permission gate model** — allow-list, deny-all, and interactive-prompt gates,
  with a callback surface for the embedder. One-shot mode defaults fail-closed
  (an empty allow-list denies every tool) because it cannot prompt an operator.
- Sandboxing and worktree isolation are left to an agent's own tools rather than
  imposed by the harness.

### Reliability (multi-agent failure-mode mitigations)

- Full context provenance: every context segment records where it came from
  (a 9-variant provenance model).
- Literal prefix inheritance — no lossy summarization of inherited context.
- Repeated-step detection.
- Mandatory budgets (token and deadline), enforced as hard ceilings.
- Result-contract schema validation with a single retry, then an explicit
  refusal rather than a silent bad result.

### Security

- Anthropic OAuth subscription tokens (`sk-ant-oat…`) are rejected at three
  layers — conway is metered-API-key only, by design.
- Cross-session agent access is rejected (`AgentNotInSession`); an agent handle
  cannot drive a session it does not belong to.

### Known limitations (deliberate for 0.1.0)

- No Claude Pro/Max subscription authentication — metered API keys only.
- `--model` is accepted by the CLI parser but not yet wired to a facade pin field.
- Cross-*backend-kind* failover has unit coverage but no end-to-end integration
  test yet.
- No bundled example third-party plugin, and OSS-release docs (README,
  plugin-author guide) are not yet written.
